# CPSC 3500 Project 1

Strengths: Our program is very readable, and tricky bits of code are well commented. Our code is also cleanly broken down into
           separate source files, making it easier to read.The runtime complexity is pretty decent too with a O(n). 
           Additionally, our program works for almost all of the test cases listed in the document for functionality.
           We do not have any memory leaks.
           
Weaknesses: The test case for multiple pipes and a lot of data does not work - we get a file not found error. 

Contributions
      Kelsey: Brought the whole project together, got the parsing and the pipes to work in its final form, 
      made code much more readable.
      
      Nathan: Wrote initial parsing code, got one command test case to work
      
      Bailey: Provided crucial insight and advice when debugging
